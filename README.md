# Tushar-Talking--Agent
Tushar Talking Agent is a smart AI-powered calendar assistant that lets users book meetings using natural language like:

- "Book a meeting on 12th July at 6 PM"
- "Do I have time this Friday?"
- "Schedule something tomorrow afternoon"

It uses FastAPI for the backend and Streamlit for the frontend, integrated with Google Calendar.
